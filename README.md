# Interactive Music Experience – Album Player

## Concept Overview
This project is an interactive music experience centered around the music of Daft punk. Users can explore albums, listen to songs, and interact with 3D elements.

The main idea is to allow users to:
- Play music by scanning targets.
- View album covers and song titles.
- Wear the iconic Daft Punk helmets.

## Face Interaction
- Users can switch between helmets using a button.
- The selected helmet will be displayed on the users face.
- The text **"DAFT"** and **"PUNK"** appears across the character’s eyes on every helmet.

## Image / Target Interaction
- When a target is scanned, an album related to the song will appear.
- The system displays:
  - Album cover art
  - Song title
  - A rotating vinyl record animation
- Music playback starts automatically after target detection.
