# Markers – Daft Punk AR Companion

This folder contains the **original marker images** used to compile `assets/targets.mind` with the MindAR Image Compiler.

The four fixed filenames:

- `target-0.png`
- `target-1.png`
- `target-2.png`
- `target-3.png`

This order **exactly matches** the order in which the images were added in the MindAR compiler.

## Subject

**Subject:** Daft Punk – albums and music.  
Each marker shows a Daft Punk–related visual (album cover or artwork) that is enlarged in the AR layer with a virtual vinyl record and a track.

## How were the targets obtained?

Describe here briefly how you made/obtained the markers (so it is clear whether they are scans, screenshots or photos):

- _Example text – replace with your situation:_
  - `target-0.png`: **screenshot** of official album cover (source: `[link]`), then cropped and optimised for contrast.
  - `target-1.png`: **photo** of own vinyl sleeve, straightened in Photoshop.
  - `target-2.png`: **download** of press image from official site, then resized.
  - `target-3.png`: **screenshot** of Spotify/Apple Music album art, cropped to square.

Make sure you mention for each target at least:

1. Whether it is a **scan, photo, print, screenshot** or download.
2. If possible a **source** (link to official site/label, or note “own physical record scanned”).

## Link with AR content

In `image.html` the mapping is as follows:

- `target-0.png` (`targetIndex: 0`) → first album cover (`album 1.jpg`) + vinyl + **Song 1**.
- `target-1.png` (`targetIndex: 1`) → second album cover (`album 2.jpg`) + vinyl + **Song 2**.
- `target-2.png` (`targetIndex: 2`) → third album cover (`album 3.jpg`) + vinyl + **Song 3**.
- `target-3.png` (`targetIndex: 3`) → fourth album cover (`album 4.jpg`) + vinyl + **Song 4**.

The teacher can print these `target-*.png` files or display them on a second screen to test the image tracking.
